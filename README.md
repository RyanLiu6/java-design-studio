# Java Design Studio
## Introduction:

This course will take place over 6 weeks. In this course, we will mainly cover aspects of Software Engineering and Software Design, introducing beginner level concepts to Students. The goal is to have students be comfortable with the idea of working on projects on their own spare time not as &quot;homework&quot; but as something they will enjoy.

## Class Outline

Each class will be roughly 2 hours, with a schedule (can be changed) of:

1. Check and Discuss Homework (30 minutes)
2. Lecture about Software Engineering (30 minutes)
* Class 1 – Software Architecture and Structure
* Class 2- Software Design
* Class 3 – Trello (Task boards)
* Class 4 – Github part 1
* Class 5 – Github part 2
* Class 6 – Implementation and Tests
3. &quot;Lab&quot; time (60 minutes)
* Specifically, students will be working on projects during this 60 minutes, and I will spend a proportionate amount of time with students 1 on 1 or 1 on 2.
* We will have discussions about their progress and what kind of technologies they have chosen to work with and develop in.
* This is the time that Students can ask me about any issues or confusion they are facing
* If we have 2 students, they I will have 30 minutes per Student (60/2)

## Project Structure:

### Outline:

For this course, the Students will have the chance to pick the project they are most interested in working on. For this matter, I will be providing around 3 – 4 different &quot;topics&quot; that Students can choose from.

### Possible Project Topics:

1. Library Management Systems (With GUI + maybe Databases)
2. Simple Game with GUI (Tic Tac Toe or Pacman – high difficulty)
3. Home Calculator with GUI (can be extremely complex to include Integrals / Derivatives)
4. Any possible ideas Students suggest



### Requirements:

1. Must include the following &quot;technical&quot; aspects:
* Classes / Objects
* Inheritance and Polymorphism – implementation up to Students (Abstract Class vs Interface)
* GUI if applicable
* Substantial processing element – an algorithm that does &quot;something&quot;, not just a shell of a program
* Choice of at least TWO of the following aspects:
  * Connectivity with the Internet (REST or otherwise)
  * Database
  * User Information (Registration, Log in, etc)
  * Push notification
2. Proper documentation for their code
* Must include how others can use your code and further develop it
3. Proper Testing – Unit and System at the MINIMUM
4. Design documents – Exact details up to Students
* Diagrams
* Flowcharts
* etc
