# First Class
## Step 1 (20 Minutes)
Discuss about Students' experiences in programming and Java
Assign Homework_1 (Introduction, HackerRank Strings, BigNumber, Data Structures)

## Step 2 (10 Minutes)
Introduce Students to sample project ideas

Note: Students do NOT have to pick a project that is listed, but can think of ideas / projects they want to pursue on their own. As the instructor, I need to gauge the difficulty before I can give the OK for Students.

We will aim to have Students pick their project by the end of the first hour.

## Step 3 (30 Minutes)
Short Lecture on Software Architecture and Structure.

## Step 4 (60 Minutes)
Lab time! Time for Students to work individually.
